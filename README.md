Machine Learning Project Checklist
1. Frame the problem and look at the big picture
	What's the objective?
	What is the existing solution?
	Select performance measure (ex. RMSE, MAE)
	Check the assumptions
2. Get the data
3. Explore the data to gain insights
4. Prepare the data to better expose the underlying data patterns to Machine Learning algorithms
5. Explore many different models and shortlist the best ones
7. Present your solution
8. Launch, monitor, and maintain your system
